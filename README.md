## Thoughts/Future Ideas:

While working on this portfolio I started coming up with a lot of things I wanted to do, but ended up settling for hitting all the requirements with the plans to come back and add more later. Here's some of the things I'm hoping to take care of in the near future:
- More design work
- Proper page routing
- Project Cards
    - Logic to display either live page link or demo video link based on which is available
    - Change box displayed over image to only have project title and links
    - Add card box under each image to host the description as well as list of tech utilized in app
- Light Mode / Dark Mode slider
- Contact Form
    - Make submission work
    - Streamline custom styling
    - Validate data types
    - Fix the auto-complete changing the background color
- Displayed resume to resize during mobile viewing
- Tools
    - Add to list of tools
